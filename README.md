# Stack Data Structure Implementation

This project aims to create a stack data structure by following these instructions:

## Instructions

1. **Reverse Function:**
   Define a function called `reverse()` that places the elements of one stack into another stack in reverse order.

2. **Dynamic Capacity:**
   When a new element is added to a stack using `push()`, if the stack is full, implement a `push()` function to double its capacity dynamically.

3. **Optimize for Space:**
   When an element is deleted from a stack with `pop()`, if the number of elements in the stack drops below 1/4, update the `pop()` function to reduce the capacity of the stack by half.
